# Screen Reader with On-Off Button

**Version:** 1.0  
**Description:**  
This Chrome extension provides a lightweight screen reader that users can toggle on and off via a popup interface or keyboard shortcuts. It enhances webpage accessibility by reading out visible elements and offering keyboard navigation features.

## How It Works

- **Popup Interface (`popup.html`, `popup.js`)**:  
  Allows users to enable/disable the screen reader and keyboard shortcuts via checkboxes.

- **Content Script (`content_script.js`)**:  
  Injected into every webpage, it highlights and reads aloud elements as the user navigates. It also listens for key events to control functionality.

- **Background Service Worker (`background.js`)**:  
  Handles messaging between the popup and content scripts, ensuring state is synchronized.

- **Manifest (`manifest.json`)**:  
  Defines the extension's configuration, including permissions, scripts, and icons.
